My expectations about the course:

I hope to gain a comprehensive understanding of both foundational and programming languages that we will discuss in this course. I also aim to become proficient in these languages and adhere to best practices in web development, especially that I want to pursue a career in this field.

Moreover, I hope for a harmonious atmosphere within our section, helping each other out whenever someone needs it. Lastly, as we collaborate on future projects, I hope that our collective efforts will lead to success.
