My expectations about the course:

I hope to gain a comprehensive understanding of both foundational and programming languages that we will discuss in this course. I also aim to become proficient in these languages and adhere to best practices in web development, especially that I want to pursue a career in this field.

Moreover, I hope for a harmonious atmosphere within our section, helping each other out whenever someone needs it. Lastly, as we collaborate on future projects, I hope that our collective efforts will lead to success.

Marquez - Reaction:

I agree with Daphne's expectations regarding the course. 
I believe that it will be manageable, and there are numerous aspects of web programming to delve into and learn from. 
My aspiration is that we will successfully navigate the course and emerge with a deep understanding. 
Ideally, the final project won't be overly challenging or excessively time-consuming. 
Moreover, fostering a sense of camaraderie within the class could be beneficial; 
perhaps incorporating group activities and even small games before our discussions could help achieve this goal.
